# ENGN-8170-Solar-Stage
This is the Code Repository for ENGN 8170 Group Solar Stage

Project Scope:
The project aims to build an ultra-low temperature sample stage, which can be utilized to detect the temperature-dependent optoelectronic properties of large-scale optoelectronic devices (i.e., solar cells, the practical device area, etc.). This project not only can help the solar PV group at ANU expand their research significantly to explore many intriguing phenomena at low temperatures (-195 degrees), but also can help them to collaborate with other optoelectronic research groups around the world.

Outcomes:
The team expects that the final product can be operated under the temperature range from -195 degrees to 300 degrees, the liquid nitrogen will be used for cooling, and the coil for heating. 5cm Ã— 5cm optoelectronic devices can be used for the sample stage. Besides the temperature control function, the sample stage also needs to have the ability to detect the real-time voltage and current curve of the PV cell.
